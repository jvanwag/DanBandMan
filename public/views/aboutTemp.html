  Repair Warranty

<div  class="warInf">
  The service/repair warranty covers adjustments and repairs of the most common issues. Pads and corks that are incomplete, torn, or not functional have been replaced as necessary and will be replaced through the term of your warranty. This does not mean that that all pads and corks are new on the instrument you purchased. Materials that are a little used may not be replaced on your instrument since pads and corks can last for several years but they are guaranteed to seal and function properly. The warranty covers all adjustments including accidently bent keys and other alterations that are needed. What is not covered is other damage/ breakage caused from accidents or improper care seeing that these parts may not be available to me and might come to substantial additional expenses. If the clarinet plastic or keys break or another issue arises that is not covered by the warranty I will try to help you and give you access to my discounted repair services.Your instrument warranty length is for 4 months if your purchase price was under $200 and 6 months if it was over $200.
