    I found a great link that goes over your maintenance very well so instead of retyping the info Iâ€™ll just share the link.

    A side note to this info is that I would only clean the mouthpiece every 3-4 weeks. Properly rinsing before playing should decrease the need for frequent cleaning and thus decrease wear and tear.
