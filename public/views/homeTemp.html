    I am a musician and technician and enjoy selling quality instruments at a great price. I started playing clarinet in 6th grade and have repaired instruments since then. I have a degree in clarinet performance from Brigham Young University and in addition have studied with some of the greatest professional musicians and technicians. I have taught music as a private instructor for almost 20 years and I continue to work with band directors in their efforts to provide a quality education. Knowing what the best instruments to provide to students is not only important to me as a musician but also as a business owner. My inventory consists of instruments that I and other teachers recommend. I am a bargain hunter but also appreciate quality items and that is how I have come to provide a great value for you. Working from home has allowed me to keep costs low and gives you extended hours that I can be available for your needs . Feel free to contact me anytime with questions or to schedule a local pickup.
